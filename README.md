# GraphQlAPI

Created a simply GraphQl with a in memory database. Used graphical to test the api. I created this due to my interest in fitness and wanted protein bars (one of my favorite snacks) into a usable GraphQL api.


Also... Thanks to AmigosCode for creating such a great graphql tutorial that I was able to learn and create my own api from :)
